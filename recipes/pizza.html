      step-by-step guide. Bellissimo!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <h2>For the base</h2>
      <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
      <h2>For the tomato sauce</h2>
      <li>100ml passata</li>
      <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
      <h2>For the topping</h2>
      <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
      <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
      <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <h2>To finish</h2>
      <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast
        and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and
        bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet
        dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until
        smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to
        rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then
        season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on
        with shaping the base.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead,
        then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into
        large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to
        be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two
        floured baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking
        sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth
        sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and
        tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its
        baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins
        until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if
        using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
