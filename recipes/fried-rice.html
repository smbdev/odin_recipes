    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Make your own healthy egg-fried rice with our easy recipe. Use leftover
      rice, or cook and dry it on a plate before using so it doesn't stick to
      the wok
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>250g long grain rice</li>
      <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped/li></li>
      <li>14 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 spring onions, sliced, to serve/li></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to
        steam-dry and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the
        onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir
        and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a
        little, then mix in with the rice - stir vigorously to coat the grains
        or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer
        before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and
        scatter over the spring onion to serve. You can also add sesame oil,
        ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.
