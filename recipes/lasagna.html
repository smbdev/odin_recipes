    <h2>Easy Lasagna Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy
      ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce,
      <strong> and lots of mozzarella cheese.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftofers freeze and
      reheat
      <em>super well.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <p>
      <h4>Prep Work</h4> Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set
      aside. Measure out remaining ingredients. <h4>Make the Meat Sauce</h4> Heat olive
      oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10
      minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice
      offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.) Add the ground beef and sausage
      and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so
      that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked
      through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease. Add the
      chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides
      of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and
      Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover
      partially and let the sauce simmer gently. <h4>Preheat Oven and Cook the
        Lasagna Noodles</h4> Preheat oven to 375°. Begin boiling a large pot of salted
      pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook
      the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to
      ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon
      throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse
      with cold water until noodles are completely cool. Lay the cooled noodles
      flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.
      <h4>Assemble</h4> Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch
      casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.
      Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by
      about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce. Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the
      ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce. Finish with 4 more lasagna
      noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.
      Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese. Spray foil with nonstick cooking
      spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent
      the cheese from sticking to it. <h4>Bake </h4>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and
      bake for 10 more minutes. Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it
      sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with
      garlic bread with cheese. <h3>Notes</h3> <h4>Pro Tips:</h4> Flavor Enhancers: The hot sauce
      and Worcestershire sauce are flavor enhancers and can’t be tasted
      outright. The hot sauce won’t make it hot/spicy. I use Frank's Hot Sauce.
      Marinara Sauce: I recommend using Rao’s marinara sauce for this recipe,
      it’s very high quality, lasagna is a labor of love that deserves quality
      ingredients. Cheese: Shred and grate the cheese from a block, avoid using
      packaged shredded/grated cheese for this recipe. Low moisture, whole milk
      mozzarella cheese melts the best. I use Dragone mozzarella, Belgioioso
      Parmesan, and Galbani Whole Milk Ricotta. Lasagna Noodles: No-boil lasagna
      noodles or fresh lasagna noodles can also be used for this recipe, neither
      of which need to be cooked first. Fresh lasagna noodles can be found in
      the deli section of the grocery store. Casserole Dish: If your lasagna is
      very close to the top of your casserole dish, place a baking sheet
      underneath the casserole dish to catch any splatters of sauce, as it gets
      hot and bubbly toward the end. This is the Staub casserole dish that I use
      for this recipe and it fits this lasagna perfectly. Storage: Store in an
      airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3
      months. Leftovers do freeze well. Make-Ahead Method: Assemble as outlined
      but do not bake. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up
      to 3 months. Thaw frozen lasagna completely before baking. Let chilled
      lasagna sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to baking. Add an
      additional 10 minutes to covered baking time. Reheating Leftovers: To
      reheat leftover lasagna, place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole
      dish. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes. The Nutritional Info shared is an
      estimate and is per serving. There are 12 servings in this recipe.
